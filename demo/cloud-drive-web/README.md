# Cloud Drive Web (APEX Demo)

The Cloud Drive web service provides a simple interface and REST API for the management of files. These may be simple plaintext files made available via standard OAuth 2.0. Or, they may be encrypted files which can be accessed and modified via the APEX protocol suite in combination with OAuth.

The service is designed to be used alongside the [Cloud Notes](../cloud-notes) app to demonstrate the cross-app data sharing made possible by APEX. The optional [Cloud Drive Mobile](../cloud-drive-mobile) app shows this working across devices.
