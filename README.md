The _**A**uthentication **P**rotocol **E**ncyrption **E**xtension (**APEX**)_ is a protocol suite which can be deployed atop an existing authorisation protocol such as [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) to enable cross-app sharing of encrypted user data. This results in systems which respect user privacy while retaining the convenience of cloud computing.
